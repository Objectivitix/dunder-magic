# dunder-magic
An ever-growing collection of bizzare/cursed projects I've created to demonstrate the sheer power of dunder methods. From lists who never raise `IndexError`s by wrapping the index, to functions whose invocation is performed with sqaure brackets.

I try to document the files as clearly as possible. Enjoy!
