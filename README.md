# dunder-magic
An ever-growing collection of bizzare/cursed projects I've created to demonstrate the sheer power of dunder methods. From lists who never raise `IndexError`s by wrapping the index, to functions whose invocation is performed with sqaure brackets.

I try to document the files as clearly as possible. Enjoy!

## Files
`wrappedlist.py` - demonstrating `__getitem__`, `__setitem__`, `__delitem__`, and arithmetic dunders.
`squarefunction.py` - demonstrating `__getitem__`, `__call__`, and `__get__`.
`easysubsuper.py` - demonstrating rich comparison dunders in a metaclass.
